You may not\nattempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\nForm.\n\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n\nIf You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n\n(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code\n    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of\n    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\n    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more\n    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n\n(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\n    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\n    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter\n    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n\n3.3.

If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\nSoftware with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\nCovered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\nLicense permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\nunder the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\nthe Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\nSoftware under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\nLicense(s).\n\n3.4.

Moreover, Your grants from a particular\nContributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor\nnotifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the\nfirst time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License\nfrom such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after\nYour receipt of the notice.\n\n5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\ninfringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,\ncounter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version\ndirectly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to\nYou by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section\n2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n\n5.3.

You may not\nattempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\nForm.\n\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n\nIf You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n\n(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code\n    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of\n    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\n    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more\n    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n\n(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\n    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\n    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter\n    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n\n3.3.

You may not\nattempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\nForm.\n\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n\nIf You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n\n(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code\n    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of\n    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\n    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more\n    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n\n(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\n    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\n    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter\n    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n\n3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n\nYou may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\nprovided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\nthe Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\nSoftware with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\nCovered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\nLicense permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\nunder the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\nthe Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\nSoftware under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\nLicense(s).\n\n3.4.

Miscellaneous\n----------------\n\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject\nmatter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\nunenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\nnecessary to make it enforceable.

You may not\nattempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\nForm.\n\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n\nIf You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n\n(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code\n    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of\n    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\n    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more\n    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n\n(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\n    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\n    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter\n    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n\n3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n\nYou may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\nprovided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\nthe Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\nSoftware with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\nCovered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\nLicense permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\nunder the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\nthe Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\nSoftware under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\nLicense(s).\n\n3.4.

Miscellaneous\n----------------\n\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject\nmatter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\nunenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\nnecessary to make it enforceable.

You may not\nattempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\nForm.\n\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n\nIf You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n\n(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code\n    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of\n    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\n    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more\n    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n\n(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\n    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\n    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter\n    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n\n3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n\nYou may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\nprovided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\nthe Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\nSoftware with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\nCovered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\nLicense permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\nunder the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\nthe Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\nSoftware under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\nLicense(s).\n\n3.4.

Miscellaneous\n----------------\n\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject\nmatter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\nunenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\nnecessary to make it enforceable.

You may not\nattempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\nForm.\n\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n\nIf You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n\n(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code\n    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of\n    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\n    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more\n    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n\n(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\n    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\n    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter\n    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n\n3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n\nYou may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\nprovided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\nthe Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\nSoftware with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\nCovered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\nLicense permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\nunder the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\nthe Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\nSoftware under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\nLicense(s).\n\n3.4.

Moreover, Your grants from a particular\nContributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor\nnotifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the\nfirst time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License\nfrom such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after\nYour receipt of the notice.\n\n5.2.

Miscellaneous\n----------------\n\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject\nmatter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\nunenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\nnecessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides\nthat the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter\nshall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.\n\n10.

Distribution of Source Form\n\nAll distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any\nModifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under\nthe terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source\nCode Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this\nLicense, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not\nattempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\nForm.\n\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n\nIf You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n\n(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code\n    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of\n    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\n    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more\n    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n\n(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\n    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\n    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter\n    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n\n3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n\nYou may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\nprovided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\nthe Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\nSoftware with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\nCovered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\nLicense permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\nunder the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\nthe Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\nSoftware under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\nLicense(s).\n\n3.4. Notices\n\nYou may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices\n(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,\nor limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of\nthe Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to\nthe extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n\n3.5. Application of Additional Terms\n\nYou may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\nindemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\nSoftware. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on\nbehalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any\nsuch warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by\nYou alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\nliability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\nindemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional\ndisclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any\njurisdiction.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\nLicense with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to\nstatute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\nthe terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\ndescribe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must\nbe placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered\nSoftware under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute\nor regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a\nrecipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n\n5. Termination\n--------------\n\n5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically\nif You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become\ncompliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular\nContributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such\nContributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an\nongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the\nnon-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have\ncome back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular\nContributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor\nnotifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the\nfirst time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License\nfrom such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after\nYour receipt of the notice.\n\n5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\ninfringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,\ncounter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version\ndirectly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to\nYou by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section\n2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n\n5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all\nend user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which\nhave been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License\nprior to termination shall survive termination.\n\n************************************************************************\n*                                                                      *\n*  6.

Miscellaneous\n----------------\n\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject\nmatter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\nunenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\nnecessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides\nthat the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter\nshall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.\n\n10.

For previous versions, see:\n\n* [v5 docs](https://github.com/neutrinojs/webpack-chain/tree/v5)\n* [v4 docs](https://github.com/neutrinojs/webpack-chain/tree/v4)\n* [v3 docs](https://github.com/neutrinojs/webpack-chain/tree/v3)\n* [v2 docs](https://github.com/neutrinojs/webpack-chain/tree/v2)\n* [v1 docs](https://github.com/neutrinojs/webpack-chain/tree/v1)\n\n_Note: while webpack-chain is utilized extensively in Neutrino, this package is\ncompletely standalone and can be used by any project._\n\n**[Chinese docs(中文文档)](https://github.com/Yatoo2018/webpack-chain/tree/zh-cmn-Hans)**\n\n## Introduction\n\nwebpack's core configuration is based on creating and modifying a\npotentially unwieldy JavaScript object. While this is OK for configurations\non individual projects, trying to share these objects across projects and\nmake subsequent modifications gets messy, as you need to have a deep\nunderstanding of the underlying object structure to make those changes.\n\n`webpack-chain` attempts to improve this process by providing a chainable or\nfluent API for creating and modifying webpack configurations. Key portions\nof the API can be referenced by user-specified names, which helps to\nstandardize how to modify a configuration across projects.\n\nThis is easier explained through the examples following.\n\n## Installation\n\n`webpack-chain` requires Node.js v6.9 and higher. `webpack-chain` also\nonly creates configuration objects designed for use in webpack versions 2, 3,\nand 4.\n\nYou may install this package using either Yarn or npm (choose one):\n\n**Yarn**\n\n```bash\nyarn add --dev webpack-chain\n```\n\n**npm**\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev webpack-chain\n```\n\n## Getting Started\n\nOnce you have `webpack-chain` installed, you can start creating a\nwebpack configuration. For this guide, our example base configuration will\nbe `webpack.config.js` in the root of our project directory.\n\n```js\n// Require the webpack-chain module. This module exports a single\n// constructor function for creating a configuration API.\nconst Config = require('webpack-chain');\n\n// Instantiate the configuration with a new API\nconst config = new Config();\n\n// Make configuration changes using the chain API.\n// Every API call tracks a change to the stored configuration.\n\nconfig\n  // Interact with entry points\n  .entry('index')\n    .add('src/index.js')\n    .end()\n  // Modify output settings\n  .output\n    .path('dist')\n    .filename('[name].bundle.js');\n\n// Create named rules which can be modified later\nconfig.module\n  .rule('lint')\n    .test(/\\.js$/)\n    .pre()\n    .include\n      .add('src')\n      .end()\n    // Even create named uses (loaders)\n    .use('eslint')\n      .loader('eslint-loader')\n      .options({\n        rules: {\n          semi: 'off'\n        }\n      });\n\nconfig.module\n  .rule('compile')\n    .test(/\\.js$/)\n    .include\n      .add('src')\n      .add('test')\n      .end()\n    .use('babel')\n      .loader('babel-loader')\n      .options({\n        presets: [\n          ['@babel/preset-env', { modules: false }]\n        ]\n      });\n\n// Create named plugins too!\nconfig\n  .plugin('clean')\n    .use(CleanPlugin, [['dist'], { root: '/dir' }]);\n\n// Export the completed configuration object to be consumed by webpack\nmodule.exports = config.toConfig();\n```\n\nHaving shared configurations is also simple. Just export the configuration\nand call `.toConfig()` prior to passing to webpack.\n\n```js\n// webpack.core.js\nconst Config = require('webpack-chain');\nconst config = new Config();\n\n// Make configuration shared across targets\n// ...\n\nmodule.exports = config;\n\n// webpack.dev.js\nconst config = require('./webpack.core');\n\n// Dev-specific configuration\n// ...\nmodule.exports = config.toConfig();\n\n// webpack.prod.js\nconst config = require('./webpack.core');\n\n// Production-specific configuration\n// ...\nmodule.exports = config.toConfig();\n```\n\n## ChainedMap\n\nOne of the core API interfaces in webpack-chain is a `ChainedMap`. A\n`ChainedMap` operates similar to a JavaScript Map, with some conveniences for\nchaining and generating configuration. If a property is marked as being a\n`ChainedMap`, it will have an API and methods as described below:\n\n**Unless stated otherwise, these methods will return the `ChainedMap`, allowing\nyou to chain these methods.**\n\n```js\n// Remove all entries from a Map.\nclear()\n```\n\n```js\n// Remove a single entry from a Map given its key.\n// key: *\ndelete(key)\n```\n\n```js\n// Fetch the value from a Map located at the corresponding key.\n// key: *\n// returns: value\nget(key)\n```\n\n```js\n// Fetch the value from a Map located at the corresponding key.\n// If the key is missing, the key is set to the result of function fn.\n// key: *\n// fn: Function () -> value\n// returns: value\ngetOrCompute(key, fn)\n```\n\n```js\n// Set a value on the Map stored at the `key` location.\n// key: *\n// value: *\nset(key, value)\n```\n\n```js\n// Returns `true` or `false` based on whether a Map as has a value set at a\n// particular key.\n// key: *\n// returns: Boolean\nhas(key)\n```\n\n```js\n// Returns an array of all the values stored in the Map.\n// returns: Array\nvalues()\n```\n\n```js\n// Returns an object of all the entries in the backing Map\n// where the key is the object property, and the value\n// corresponding to the key. Will return `undefined` if the backing\n// Map is empty.\n// This will order properties by their name if the value is\n// a ChainedMap that used .before() or .after().\n// returns: Object, undefined if empty\nentries()\n```\n\n```js\n// Provide an object which maps its properties and values\n// into the backing Map as keys and values.\n// You can also provide an array as the second argument\n// for property names to omit from being merged.\n// obj: Object\n// omit: Optional Array\nmerge(obj, omit)\n```\n\n```js\n// Execute a function against the current configuration context\n// handler: Function -> ChainedMap\n  // A function which is given a single argument of the ChainedMap instance\nbatch(handler)\n```\n\n```js\n// Conditionally execute a function to continue configuration\n// condition: Boolean\n// whenTruthy: Function -> ChainedMap\n  // invoked when condition is truthy, given a single argument of the ChainedMap instance\n// whenFalsy: Optional Function -> ChainedMap\n  // invoked when condition is falsy, given a single argument of the ChainedMap instance\nwhen(condition, whenTruthy, whenFalsy)\n```\n\n## ChainedSet\n\nAnother of the core API interfaces in webpack-chain is a `ChainedSet`. A\n`ChainedSet` operates similar to a JavaScript Set, with some conveniences for\nchaining and generating configuration. If a property is marked as being a\n`ChainedSet`, it will have an API and methods as described below:\n\n**Unless stated otherwise, these methods will return the `ChainedSet`, allowing\nyou to chain these methods.**\n\n```js\n// Add/append a value to the end of a Set.\n// value: *\nadd(value)\n```\n\n```js\n// Add a value to the beginning of a Set.\n// value: *\nprepend(value)\n```\n\n```js\n// Remove all values from a Set.\nclear()\n```\n\n```js\n// Remove a specific value from a Set.\n// value: *\ndelete(value)\n```\n\n```js\n// Returns `true` or `false` based on whether or not the\n// backing Set contains the specified value.\n// value: *\n// returns: Boolean\nhas(value)\n```\n\n```js\n// Returns an array of values contained in the backing Set.\n// returns: Array\nvalues()\n```\n\n```js\n// Concatenates the given array to the end of the backing Set.\n// arr: Array\nmerge(arr)\n```\n\n```js\n// Execute a function against the current configuration context\n// handler: Function -> ChainedSet\n  // A function which is given a single argument of the ChainedSet instance\nbatch(handler)\n```\n\n```js\n// Conditionally execute a function to continue configuration\n// condition: Boolean\n// whenTruthy: Function -> ChainedSet\n  // invoked when condition is truthy, given a single argument of the ChainedSet instance\n// whenFalsy: Optional Function -> ChainedSet\n  // invoked when condition is falsy, given a single argument of the ChainedSet instance\nwhen(condition, whenTruthy, whenFalsy)\n```\n\n## Shorthand methods\n\nA number of shorthand methods exist for setting a value on a `ChainedMap`\nwith the same key as the shorthand method name.\nFor example, `devServer.hot` is a shorthand method, so it can be used as:\n\n```js\n// A shorthand method for setting a value on a ChainedMap\ndevServer.hot(true);\n\n// This would be equivalent to:\ndevServer.set('hot', true);\n```\n\nA shorthand method is chainable, so calling it will return the original\ninstance, allowing you to continue to chain.\n\n### Config\n\nCreate a new configuration object.\n\n```js\nconst Config = require('webpack-chain');\n\nconst config = new Config();\n```\n\nMoving to deeper points in the API will change the context of what you\nare modifying. You can move back to the higher context by either referencing\nthe top-level `config` again, or by calling `.end()` to move up one level.\nIf you are familiar with jQuery, `.end()` works similarly. All API calls\nwill return the API instance at the current context unless otherwise\nspecified. This is so you may chain API calls continuously if desired.\n\nFor details on the specific values that are valid for all shorthand and\nlow-level methods, please refer to their corresponding name in the\n[webpack docs hierarchy](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/).\n\n```js\nConfig : ChainedMap\n```\n\n#### Config shorthand methods\n\n```js\nconfig\n  .amd(amd)\n  .bail(bail)\n

You cannot use both `.before()` and `.after()` on the same `oneOf`.\n\n```js\nconfig.module\n  .rule(name)\n    .oneOf(name)\n      .after()\n\n// Example\n\nconfig.module\n  .rule('scss')\n    .test(/\\.scss$/)\n    .oneOf('vue')\n      .resourceQuery(/\\?vue/)\n      .use('vue-style')\n        .loader('vue-style-loader')\n        .end()\n      .end()\n    .oneOf('normal')\n      .use('sass')\n        .loader('sass-loader')\n        .end()\n      .end()\n    .oneOf('sass-vars')\n      .after('vue')\n      .resourceQuery(/\\?sassvars/)\n      .use('sass-vars')\n        .loader('sass-vars-to-js-loader')\n```\n\n#### Config module rules resolve\n\nSpecify a resolve configuration to be merged over the default `config.resolve`\nfor modules that match the rule.\n\nSee \"Config resolve\" sections above for full syntax.\n\n**Note:** This option is supported by webpack since 4.36.1.\n\n```js\nconfig.module\n  .rule(name)\n    .resolve\n\n// Example\n\nconfig.module\n  .rule('scss')\n    .test(/\\.scss$/)\n    .resolve\n      .symlinks(true)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Merging Config\n\nwebpack-chain supports merging in an object to the configuration instance which\nmatches a layout similar to how the webpack-chain schema is laid out.\n\n**Note:** This object does not match the webpack configuration schema exactly\n(for example the `[name]` keys for entry/rules/plugins), so you may need to transform\nwebpack configuration objects (such as those output by webpack-chain's `.toConfig()`)\nto match the layout below prior to passing to `.merge()`.\n\n```js\nconfig.merge({ devtool: 'source-map' });\n\nconfig.get('devtool') // \"source-map\"\n```\n\n```js\nconfig.merge({\n  [key]: value,\n\n  amd,\n  bail,\n  cache,\n  context,\n  devtool,\n  externals,\n  loader,\n  mode,\n  parallelism,\n  profile,\n  recordsPath,\n  recordsInputPath,\n  recordsOutputPath,\n  stats,\n  target,\n  watch,\n  watchOptions,\n\n  entry: {\n    [name]: [...values]\n  },\n\n  plugin: {\n    [name]: {\n      plugin: WebpackPlugin,\n      args: [...args],\n      before,\n      after\n    }\n  },\n\n  devServer: {\n    [key]: value,\n\n    clientLogLevel,\n    compress,\n    contentBase,\n    filename,\n    headers,\n    historyApiFallback,\n    host,\n    hot,\n    hotOnly,\n    https,\n    inline,\n    lazy,\n    noInfo,\n    overlay,\n    port,\n    proxy,\n    quiet,\n    setup,\n    stats,\n    watchContentBase\n  },\n\n  node: {\n    [key]: value\n  },\n\n  optimization: {\n    concatenateModules,\n    flagIncludedChunks,\n    mergeDuplicateChunks,\n    minimize,\n    minimizer: {\n      [name]: {\n        plugin: WebpackPlugin,\n        args: [...args],\n        before,\n        after\n      }\n    },\n    namedChunks,\n    namedModules,\n    nodeEnv,\n    noEmitOnErrors,\n    occurrenceOrder,\n    portableRecords,\n    providedExports,\n    removeAvailableModules,\n    removeEmptyChunks,\n    runtimeChunk,\n    sideEffects,\n    splitChunks,\n    usedExports,\n  },\n\n  performance: {\n    [key]: value,\n\n    hints,\n    maxEntrypointSize,\n    maxAssetSize,\n    assetFilter\n  },\n\n  resolve: {\n    [key]: value,\n\n    alias: {\n      [key]: value\n    },\n    aliasFields: [...values],\n    descriptionFields: [...values],\n    extensions: [...values],\n    mainFields: [...values],\n    mainFiles: [...values],\n    modules: [...values],\n\n    plugin: {\n      [name]: {\n        plugin: WebpackPlugin,\n        args: [...args],\n        before,\n        after\n      }\n    }\n  },\n\n  resolveLoader: {\n    [key]: value,\n\n    alias: {\n      [key]: value\n    },\n    aliasFields: [...values],\n    descriptionFields: [...values],\n    extensions: [...values],\n    mainFields: [...values],\n    mainFiles: [...values],\n    modules: [...values],\n    moduleExtensions: [...values],\n    packageMains: [...values],\n\n    plugin: {\n      [name]: {\n        plugin: WebpackPlugin,\n        args: [...args],\n        before,\n        after\n      }\n    }\n  },\n\n  module: {\n    [key]: value,\n\n    rule: {\n      [name]: {\n        [key]: value,\n\n        enforce,\n        issuer,\n        parser,\n        resource,\n        resourceQuery,\n        test,\n\n        include: [...paths],\n        exclude: [...paths],\n\n        rules: {\n          [name]: Rule\n        },\n\n        oneOf: {\n          [name]: Rule\n        },\n\n        use: {\n          [name]: {\n            loader: LoaderString,\n            options: LoaderOptions,\n            before,\n            after\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\n### Conditional configuration\n\nWhen working with instances of `ChainedMap` and `ChainedSet`, you can perform\nconditional configuration using `when`. You must specify an expression to\n`when()` which will be evaluated for truthiness or falsiness. If the expression\nis truthy, the first function argument will be invoked with an instance of the\ncurrent chained instance. You can optionally provide a second function to be\ninvoked when the condition is falsy, which is also given the current chained\ninstance.\n\n```js\n// Example: Only add minify plugin during production\nconfig\n  .when(process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production', config => {\n    config\n      .plugin('minify')\n      .use(BabiliWebpackPlugin);\n  });\n```\n\n```js\n// Example: Only add minify plugin during production,\n// otherwise set devtool to source-map\nconfig\n  .when(process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',\n    config => config.plugin('minify').use(BabiliWebpackPlugin),\n    config => config.devtool('source-map')\n  );\n```\n\n### Inspecting generated configuration\n\nYou can inspect the generated webpack config using `config.toString()`. This\nwill generate a stringified version of the config with comment hints for named\nrules, uses and plugins:\n\n```js\nconfig\n  .module\n    .rule('compile')\n      .test(/\\.js$/)\n      .use('babel')\n        .loader('babel-loader');\n\nconfig.toString();\n\n/*\n{\n  module: {\n    rules: [\n      /* config.module.rule('compile') */\n      {\n        test: /\\.js$/,\n        use: [\n          /* config.module.rule('compile').use('babel') */\n          {\n            loader: 'babel-loader'\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n*/\n```\n\nBy default the generated string cannot be used directly as real webpack config\nif it contains objects and plugins that need to be required. In order to\ngenerate usable config, you can customize how objects and plugins are\nstringified by setting a special `__expression` property on them:\n\n```js\nconst sass = require('sass');\nsass.__expression = `require('sass')`;\n\nclass MyPlugin {}\nMyPlugin.__expression = `require('my-plugin')`;\n\nfunction myFunction () {}\nmyFunction.__expression = `require('my-function')`;\n\nconfig\n  .plugin('example')\n    .use(MyPlugin, [{ fn: myFunction, implementation: sass, }]);\n\nconfig.toString();\n\n/*\n{\n  plugins: [\n    new (require('my-plugin'))({\n      fn: require('my-function'),\n      implementation: require('sass')\n    })\n  ]\n}\n*/\n```\n\nPlugins specified via their path will have their `require()` statement generated\nautomatically:\n\n```js\nconfig\n  .plugin('env')\n    .use(require.resolve('webpack/lib/ProvidePlugin'), [{ jQuery: 'jquery' }])\n\nconfig.toString();\n\n/*\n{\n  plugins: [\n    new (require('/foo/bar/src/node_modules/webpack/lib/EnvironmentPlugin.js'))(\n      {\n        jQuery: 'jquery'\n      }\n    )\n  ]\n}\n*/\n```\n\nYou can also call `toString` as a static method on `Config` in order to\nmodify the configuration object prior to stringifying.\n\n```js\nConfig.toString({\n  ...config.toConfig(),\n  module: {\n    defaultRules: [\n      {\n        use: [\n          {\n            loader: 'banner-loader',\n            options: { prefix: 'banner-prefix.txt' },\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n})\n```\n\n```\n{\n  plugins: [\n    /* config.plugin('foo') */\n    new TestPlugin()\n  ],\n  module: {\n    defaultRules: [\n      {\n        use: [\n          {\n            loader: 'banner-loader',\n            options: {\n              prefix: 'banner-prefix.txt'\n            }\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n[npm-image]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/webpack-chain.svg\n[npm-downloads]: https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/webpack-chain.svg\n[npm-url]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-chain\n[travis-image]: https://api.travis-ci.com/neutrinojs/webpack-chain.svg?branch=master\n[travis-url]: https://travis-ci.com/neutrinojs/webpack-chain\n","maintainers":[{"email":"edmorley@users.noreply.github.com","name":"edmorley"},{"email":"eli@eliperelman.com","name":"eliperelman"},{"email":"helfi92@gmail.com","name":"helfi92"},{"email":"timkelty@gmail.com","name":"timkelty"}],"time":{"modified":"2023-12-18T12:10:48.902Z","created":"2017-02-06T20:09:13.843Z","1.0.0":"2017-02-06T20:09:13.843Z","1.0.1":"2017-02-09T17:21:17.323Z","1.0.2":"2017-02-09T17:50:23.169Z","1.0.3":"2017-02-10T14:31:42.294Z","1.1.0":"2017-02-13T14:44:11.222Z","1.2.0":"2017-02-13T16:16:14.446Z","1.3.0":"2017-02-14T16:25:15.164Z","1.4.0":"2017-02-15T23:28:33.064Z","1.4.1":"2017-02-26T22:23:17.894Z","1.4.2":"2017-03-02T21:58:58.449Z","1.4.3":"2017-03-04T13:28:07.882Z","2.0.0":"2017-03-06T14:54:27.507Z","2.0.1":"2017-03-08T14:22:36.699Z","3.0.0":"2017-03-08T14:37:22.359Z","3.1.0":"2017-03-29T17:12:40.920Z","3.2.0":"2017-04-12T13:31:01.039Z","3.3.0":"2017-05-18T14:04:13.505Z","4.0.0":"2017-08-03T17:45:32.110Z","4.1.0":"2017-09-12T14:51:38.963Z","4.2.0":"2017-09-13T15:44:04.497Z","4.3.0":"2017-09-13T16:16:50.387Z","4.4.0":"2017-10-06T16:50:29.862Z","4.4.1":"2017-10-06T17:04:30.127Z","4.4.2":"2017-10-10T14:39:05.549Z","4.5.0":"2017-11-22T13:55:48.393Z","4.6.0":"2018-04-16T22:03:32.056Z","4.7.0":"2018-05-15T15:24:01.607Z","4.8.0":"2018-05-16T22:41:03.026Z","4.9.0":"2018-08-15T16:46:26.261Z","4.10.0":"2018-09-06T17:52:27.282Z","4.11.0":"2018-09-13T17:23:07.253Z","4.12.0":"2018-09-28T15:49:31.803Z","4.12.1":"2018-10-03T00:43:54.728Z","5.0.0":"2018-10-08T21:41:02.564Z","5.0.1":"2018-10-22T08:36:31.596Z","5.1.0":"2019-01-16T12:17:45.584Z","5.2.0":"2019-01-23T18:00:21.909Z","5.2.1":"2019-03-07T15:56:04.856Z","5.2.2":"2019-03-12T14:58:20.566Z","5.2.3":"2019-03-22T14:50:34.094Z","5.2.4":"2019-03-25T14:27:50.245Z","6.0.0":"2019-05-03T17:35:55.174Z","6.1.0":"2019-12-13T15:03:41.073Z","6.2.0":"2019-12-15T10:45:24.586Z","6.3.0":"2019-12-22T21:07:24.889Z","6.3.1":"2020-01-28T11:24:30.306Z","6.4.0":"2020-02-03T14:38:10.213Z","6.5.0":"2020-07-01T21:10:44.454Z","6.5.1":"2020-07-25T19:40:21.575Z"},"keywords":["webpack","config","chain","fluent","api"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/neutrinojs/webpack-chain.git"},"author":{"name":"Eli Perelman","email":"eli@eliperelman.com"},"license":"MPL-2.0","readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"ricardogobbosouza":true,"tommytroylin":true,"flumpus-dev":true}}
