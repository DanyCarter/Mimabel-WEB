stream-events\n\n> Get an event when you're being sent data or asked for it.\n\n## About\n\nThis is just a simple thing that tells you when `_read` and `_write` have been called, saving you the trouble of writing this yourself. You receive two events `reading` and `writing`-- no magic is performed.\n\nThis works well with [duplexify](https://github.com/mafintosh/duplexify) or lazy streams, so you can wait until you know you're being used as a stream to do something asynchronous, such as fetching an API token.\n\n\n## Use\n```sh\n$ npm install --save stream-events\n```\n```js\nvar stream = require('stream')\nvar streamEvents = require('stream-events')\nvar util = require('util')\n\nfunction MyStream() {\n  stream.Duplex.call(this)\n  streamEvents.call(this)\n}\nutil.inherits(MyStream, stream.Duplex)\n\nMyStream.prototype._read = function(chunk) {\n  console.log('_read called as usual')\n  this.push(new Buffer(chunk))\n  this.push(null)\n}\n\nMyStream.prototype._write = function() {\n  console.log('_write called as usual')\n}\n\nvar stream = new MyStream\n\nstream.on('reading', function() {\n  console.log('stream is being asked for data')\n})\n\nstream.on('writing', function() {\n  console.log('stream is being sent data')\n})\n\nstream.pipe(stream)\n```\n\n### Using with Duplexify\n```js\nvar duplexify = require('duplexify')\nvar streamEvents = require('stream-events')\nvar fs = require('fs')\n\nvar dup = streamEvents(duplexify())\n\ndup.on('writing', function() {\n  // do something async\n  dup.setWritable(/*writable stream*/)\n})\n\nfs.createReadStream('file').pipe(dup)\n```","maintainers":[{"name":"stephenplusplus","email":"sawchuk@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2022-06-27T00:46:42.834Z","created":"2014-10-16T22:51:03.471Z","1.0.0":"2014-10-16T22:51:03.471Z","1.0.1":"2014-10-16T23:19:15.702Z","1.0.2":"2017-05-08T16:34:51.280Z","1.0.3":"2018-04-02T12:49:34.858Z","1.0.4":"2018-04-13T17:17:56.302Z","1.0.5":"2018-10-26T17:11:24.761Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/stephenplusplus/stream-events","keywords":["stream","events","read","write","duplexify","lazy-stream"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/stephenplusplus/stream-events.git"},"author":{"name":"Stephen Sawchuk"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/stephenplusplus/stream-events/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"readme.md","users":{"davidbwaters":true}}
