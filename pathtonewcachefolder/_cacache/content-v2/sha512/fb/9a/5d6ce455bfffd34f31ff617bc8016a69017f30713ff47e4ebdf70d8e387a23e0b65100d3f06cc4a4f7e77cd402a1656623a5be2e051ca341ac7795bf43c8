However, if you wish to\n> use `connect`, please install [`connect`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/connect)\n> and [`qs-middleware`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/qs-middleware), in addition\n> to `apollo-server-express`.\n\n```shell\nnpm install --save connect qs-middleware apollo-server-express\n```\n\n```js\nconst connect = require('connect');\nconst { ApolloServer, gql } = require('apollo-server-express');\nconst query = require('qs-middleware');\n\n// Construct a schema, using GraphQL schema language\nconst typeDefs = gql`\n  type Query {\n    hello: String\n  }\n`;\n\n// Provide resolver functions for your schema fields\nconst resolvers = {\n  Query: {\n    hello: () => 'Hello world!',\n  },\n};\n\nconst server = new ApolloServer({ typeDefs, resolvers });\n\nconst app = connect();\nconst path = '/graphql';\n\napp.use(query());\nserver.applyMiddleware({ app, path });\n\napp.listen({ port: 4000 }, () =>\n  console.log(`🚀 Server ready at http://localhost:4000${server.graphqlPath}`)\n);\n```\n\n> Note: `qs-middleware` is only required if running outside of Meteor\n\n## Principles\n\nGraphQL Server is built with the following principles in mind:\n\n* **By the community, for the community**: GraphQL Server's development is driven by the needs of developers\n* **Simplicity**: by keeping things simple, GraphQL Server is easier to use, easier to contribute to, and more secure\n* **Performance**: GraphQL Server is well-tested and production-ready - no modifications needed\n\nAnyone is welcome to contribute to GraphQL Server, just read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), take a look at the [roadmap](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/master/ROADMAP.md) and make your first PR!\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","_id":"apollo-server-express@2.15.0-alpha.1","_nodeVersion":"10.21.0","_npmVersion":"lerna/3.22.1/node@v10.21.0+x64 (linux)","dist":{"integrity":"sha512-+DjzgZgzGgRKm8C3xaRQxVgz9GQf4CaVvnO0Or5ONdHqphGA93P4BjoiYkncSfEAfSvSt/79hZTkxbz1dpmsCQ==","shasum":"c594196f07c053148cfb7d6add4ce9af9920ed8d","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/apollo-server-express/-/apollo-server-express-2.15.0-alpha.1.tgz","fileCount":28,"unpackedSize":69950,"npm-signature":"-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\nVersion: OpenPGP.js v3.0.4\r\nComment: https://openpgpjs.org\r\n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\nRkss\r\n=gyaD\r\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\n","signatures":[{"keyid":"SHA256:jl3bwswu80PjjokCgh0o2w5c2U4LhQAE57gj9cz1kzA","sig":"MEUCIBuT8I+qWyuX44VGa+jM4KwYT1Oj8I6m0vONV6sRXRR7AiEAuj1M48DiSvdV+uM9PpYKKoNNYjZtSV9g9lp9ynVFDfA="}]},"maintainers":[{"email":"npm@apollographql.com","name":"apollo-bot"},{"email":"evanshauser@gmail.com","name":"evanshauser"}],"_npmUser":{"name":"apollo-bot","email":"npm@apollographql.com"},"directories":{},"_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/apollo-server-express_2.15.0-alpha.1_1592414293202_0.6586948369090224"},"_hasShrinkwrap":false,"deprecated":"The `apollo-server-express` package is part of Apollo Server v2 and v3, which are now deprecated (end-of-life October 22nd 2023 and October 22nd 2024, respectively).

For now, we believe that this package is still compatible with `connect` and we even run tests against `connect`, but we may choose to break this compatibility at some point without a major version bump. If you rely on the ability to use Apollo Server with `connect`, you may wish to make your own integration.\n\n## Principles\n\nGraphQL Server is built with the following principles in mind:\n\n* **By the community, for the community**: GraphQL Server's development is driven by the needs of developers\n* **Simplicity**: by keeping things simple, GraphQL Server is easier to use, easier to contribute to, and more secure\n* **Performance**: GraphQL Server is well-tested and production-ready - no modifications needed\n\nAnyone is welcome to contribute to GraphQL Server, just read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md), take a look at the [roadmap](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/main/ROADMAP.md) and make your first PR!\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","_id":"apollo-server-express@3.0.0-preview.0","_nodeVersion":"12.22.1","_npmVersion":"lerna/4.0.0/node@v12.22.1+x64 (linux)","dist":{"integrity":"sha512-mpz8gSJMQy+kmNRzdCPs4qdDWIo3vXGct+O7XIH8j7WFS5D23qcnvh3hdAvvd/xczut1zos69iKGKpprfG/s0A==","shasum":"fffc8f474010ebaf57296a34179f7e6899f7f31b","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/apollo-server-express/-/apollo-server-express-3.0.0-preview.0.tgz","fileCount":19,"unpackedSize":502687,"npm-signature":"-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\nVersion: OpenPGP.js v3.0.13\r\nComment: https://openpgpjs.org\r\n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\ntsAC\r\n=sXrH\r\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\n","signatures":[{"keyid":"SHA256:jl3bwswu80PjjokCgh0o2w5c2U4LhQAE57gj9cz1kzA","sig":"MEUCIQCII5GSvnKCvH68VyMYl/WM4U1n8IGclTWyvaay/AqswwIgZ7n+ID3DQDxtQ79CBDihUwoGTgLRPEheNqpKBSGkA1Q="}]},"_npmUser":{"name":"apollo-bot","email":"npm@apollographql.com"},"directories":{},"maintainers":[{"name":"apollo-bot","email":"npm@apollographql.com"}],"_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/apollo-server-express_3.0.0-preview.0_1622526954899_0.5825644050037284"},"_hasShrinkwrap":false,"deprecated":"The `apollo-server-express` package is part of Apollo Server v2 and v3, which are now deprecated (end-of-life October 22nd 2023 and October 22nd 2024, respectively).

For now, we believe that this package is still compatible with `connect` and we even run tests against `connect`, but we may choose to break this compatibility at some point without a major version bump.

Apollo Server is a community-maintained open-source GraphQL server that works with many Node.js HTTP server frameworks. [Read the docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/). [Read the CHANGELOG.](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)\n\n```shell\nnpm install apollo-server-express graphql\n```\n\n## Express\n\n```js\nconst express = require('express');\nconst { ApolloServer, gql } = require('apollo-server-express');\n\nasync function startApolloServer() {\n  // Construct a schema, using GraphQL schema language\n  const typeDefs = gql`\n    type Query {\n      hello: String\n    }\n  `;\n\n  // Provide resolver functions for your schema fields\n  const resolvers = {\n    Query: {\n      hello: () => 'Hello world!',\n    },\n  };\n\n  const server = new ApolloServer({ typeDefs, resolvers });\n  await server.start();\n\n  const app = express();\n  server.applyMiddleware({ app });\n\n  await new Promise(resolve => app.listen({ port: 4000 }, resolve));\n  console.log(`🚀 Server ready at http://localhost:4000${server.graphqlPath}`);\n  return { server, app };\n}\n```\n\n## Connect\n\nBefore Apollo Server 3, we officially supported using this package with `connect` as well. `connect` is an older framework that `express` evolved from. For now, we believe that this package is still compatible with `connect` and we even run tests against `connect`, but we may choose to break this compatibility at some point without a major version bump. If you rely on the ability to use Apollo Server with `connect`, you may wish to make your own integration.\n\n## Principles\n\nGraphQL Server is built with the following principles in mind:\n\n* **By the community, for the community**: GraphQL Server's development is driven by the needs of developers\n* **Simplicity**: by keeping things simple, GraphQL Server is easier to use, easier to contribute to, and more secure\n* **Performance**: GraphQL Server is well-tested and production-ready - no modifications needed\n\nAnyone is welcome to contribute to GraphQL Server, just read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md), take a look at the [roadmap](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/main/ROADMAP.md) and make your first PR!\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","_id":"apollo-server-express@3.2.0-alpha.0","_nodeVersion":"12.22.5","_npmVersion":"lerna/4.0.0/node@v12.22.5+x64 (linux)","dist":{"integrity":"sha512-4jW9yIDItpls4/+2Rk8HfIdv4FysCXu1EUBDVL7Ls9BFhYpkVU6QyeDCzVn2BA8/wPQd/+n4CYRGg4EQJQpYXQ==","shasum":"49dc20f9fa0dd3715266133455f2bacf4147b9fa","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/apollo-server-express/-/apollo-server-express-3.2.0-alpha.0.tgz","fileCount":19,"unpackedSize":99597,"npm-signature":"-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\nVersion: OpenPGP.js v3.0.13\r\nComment: https://openpgpjs.org\r\n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\nmphD\r\n=C5JQ\r\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\n","signatures":[{"keyid":"SHA256:jl3bwswu80PjjokCgh0o2w5c2U4LhQAE57gj9cz1kzA","sig":"MEQCHxuZ01Oki4U3pZs9XSsh4rIDQazVPRy11gKNh/X7R/0CIQCR+yUNaCQAsj+sbwqDMXU3zoXfdNsMufN/sw/HV9q5Dg=="}]},"_npmUser":{"name":"apollo-bot","email":"npm@apollographql.com"},"directories":{},"maintainers":[{"name":"apollo-bot","email":"npm@apollographql.com"}],"_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/apollo-server-express_3.2.0-alpha.0_1629503754095_0.009653837496224726"},"_hasShrinkwrap":false,"deprecated":"The `apollo-server-express` package is part of Apollo Server v2 and v3, which are now deprecated (end-of-life October 22nd 2023 and October 22nd 2024, respectively).

Apollo Server is a community-maintained open-source GraphQL server that works with many Node.js HTTP server frameworks. [Read the docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/). [Read the CHANGELOG.](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)\n\n\nA full example of how to use `apollo-server-express` can be found in [the docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/integrations/middleware/#apollo-server-express).\n\nBefore Apollo Server 3, we officially supported using this package with `connect` as well. `connect` is an older framework that `express` evolved from. For now, we believe that this package is still compatible with `connect` and we even run tests against `connect`, but we may choose to break this compatibility at some point without a major version bump. If you rely on the ability to use Apollo Server with `connect`, you may wish to make your own integration.\n\n## Principles\n\nGraphQL Server is built with the following principles in mind:\n\n* **By the community, for the community**: GraphQL Server's development is driven by the needs of developers\n* **Simplicity**: by keeping things simple, GraphQL Server is easier to use, easier to contribute to, and more secure\n* **Performance**: GraphQL Server is well-tested and production-ready - no modifications needed\n\nAnyone is welcome to contribute to GraphQL Server, just read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md), take a look at the [roadmap](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/main/ROADMAP.md) and make
