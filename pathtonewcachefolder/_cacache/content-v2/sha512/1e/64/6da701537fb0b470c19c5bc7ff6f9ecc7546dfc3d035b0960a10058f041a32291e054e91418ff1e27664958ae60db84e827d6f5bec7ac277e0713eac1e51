Each module is to be individually imported as explained in\neach individual module's documentation.\n\n#### \"Module not found: Error: Can't resolve '...' in '...'\"\n\nUse a supported Node.js runtime and make sure whatever tools you may use for transpiling the code also support the Subpath exports (\"exports\") feature.\n\n#### Why? Just. Why?\n\nI was using [`node-jose`][node-jose] for\n[`openid-client`](https://github.com/panva/node-openid-client) and\n[`oidc-provider`](https://github.com/panva/node-oidc-provider) and came to realize its shortcomings\nin terms of performance and API (not having well defined errors).\n\n&plus; this was an amazing opportunity to learn JOSE as a whole\n\n[documentation]: /docs/README.md\n[node-jose]:

is available\n\n`v2.x` continues being supported. It will continue receiving\nbug fixes until 2022-04-30. It will not be receiving any new\nfeatures.\n\n`v3.x` is [available](https://github.com/panva/jose) with\n\n- Revised API\n- No dependencies\n- Browser support\n- Promise-based API\n- experimental (non-blocking 🎉) Node.js libuv thread pool based runtime\n\n## Implemented specs & features\n\nThe following specifications are implemented by `jose`\n\n- JSON Web Signature (JWS) - [RFC7515][spec-jws]\n- JSON Web Encryption (JWE) - [RFC7516][spec-jwe]\n- JSON Web Key (JWK) - [RFC7517][spec-jwk]\n- JSON Web Algorithms (JWA) - [RFC7518][spec-jwa]\n- JSON Web Token (JWT) - [RFC7519][spec-jwt]\n- JSON Web Key Thumbprint - [RFC7638][spec-thumbprint]\n- JWS Unencoded Payload Option - [RFC7797][spec-b64]\n- CFRG Elliptic Curve ECDH and Signatures - [RFC8037][spec-okp]\n- secp256k1 EC Key curve support - [JOSE Registrations for WebAuthn Algorithms][spec-secp256k1]\n\nThe test suite utilizes examples defined in [RFC7520][spec-cookbook] to confirm its JOSE\nimplementation is correct.\n\nAvailable JWT validation profiles\n\n- Generic JWT\n- OIDC ID Token - [OpenID Connect Core 1.0][spec-oidc-id_token]\n- (draft 04) OIDC Logout Token - [OpenID Connect Back-Channel Logout 1.0][spec-oidc-logout_token]\n- (draft 06) OAuth 2.0 JWT Access Tokens - [JWT Profile for OAuth 2.0 Access Tokens][draft-ietf-oauth-access-token-jwt]\n\n## Support\n\nIf you or your business use `jose`, please consider becoming a [sponsor][support-sponsor] so I can continue maintaining it and adding new features carefree.\n\n## Documentation\n\n- [jose API Documentation][documentation]\n  - [JWK (JSON Web Key)][documentation-jwk]\n  - [JWKS (JSON Web Key Set)][documentation-jwks]\n  - [JWT (JSON Web Token)][documentation-jwt]\n  - [JWS (JSON Web Signature)][documentation-jws]\n  - [JWE (JSON Web Encryption)][documentation-jwe]\n\n## Usage\n\nFor the best performance Node.js version **>=12.0.0** is recommended, but **^10.13.0** lts/dubnium\nis also supported.\n\nInstalling `jose`\n\n```console\nnpm install jose@2\n```\n\nUsage\n```js\nconst jose = require('jose')\nconst {\n  JWE,   // JSON Web Encryption (JWE)\n  JWK,   // JSON Web Key (JWK)\n  JWKS,  // JSON Web Key Set (JWKS)\n  JWS,   // JSON Web Signature (JWS)\n  JWT,   // JSON Web Token (JWT)\n  errors // errors utilized by jose\n} = jose\n```\n\n#### Keys and KeyStores\n\nPrepare your Keys and KeyStores. See the [documentation][documentation-jwk] for more.\n\n```js\nconst key = jose.JWK.asKey(fs.readFileSync('path/to/key/file'))\n\nconst jwk = { kty: 'EC',\n  kid: 'dl4M_fcI7XoFCsQ22PYrQBkuxZ2pDcbDimcdFmmXM98',\n  crv: 'P-256',\n  x: 'v37avifcL-xgh8cy6IFzcINqqmFLc2JF20XUpn4Y2uQ',\n  y: 'QTwy27XgP7ZMOdGOSopAHB-FU1JMQn3J9GEWGtUXreQ' }\nconst anotherKey = jose.JWK.asKey(jwk)\n\nconst keystore = new jose.JWKS.KeyStore(key, anotherKey)\n```\n\n### JWT vs JWS\n\nThe JWT module provides IANA registered claim type and format validations on top of JWS as well as\nconvenience options for verifying UNIX timestamps, setting maximum allowed JWT age, verifying\naudiences, and more.\n\nThe JWS module on the other hand handles the other JWS Serialization Syntaxes with all their\nadditional available features and allows signing of any payload, i.e. not just serialized JSON\nobjects.\n\n#### JWT Signing\n\nSign with a private or symmetric key with plethora of convenience options. See the\n[documentation][documentation-jwt] for more.\n\n```js\njose.JWT.sign(\n  { 'urn:example:claim': 'foo' },\n  privateKey,\n  {\n    algorithm: 'PS256',\n    audience: 'urn:example:client_id',\n    expiresIn: '1 hour',\n    header: {\n      typ: 'JWT'\n    },\n    issuer: 'https://op.example.com'\n  }\n)\n```\n\n#### JWT Verifying\n\nVerify with a public or symmetric key with plethora of convenience options.

This will then perform all doable validations given the input.

The rest is to be considered\nprivate API and is subject to change between any versions.\n\n**Although.** Draft specification profiles are updated as minor versions of the library, therefore,\nsince they may have breaking changes use the `~` semver operator when using these and pay close\nattention to changelog and the drafts themselves.\n\n#### How do I use it outside of Node.js\n\nIt is **only built for >=10.13.0 Node.js** environment - including `jose` in transpiled\nbrowser-environment targeted projects is not supported and may result in unexpected results.\n\n#### How is it different from [`jws`](https://github.com/brianloveswords/node-jws), [`jwa`](https://github.com/brianloveswords/node-jwa) or [`jsonwebtoken`](https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken)?\n\n- it supports JWK Key Format for all four key types (oct, RSA, EC and OKP)\n- it is providing Key and KeyStore abstractions\n- there is JSON Web Encryption support\n- it supports all JWS / JWE Serialization Syntaxes\n- it supports the \"crit\" member validations to make sure extensions are handled correctly\n- it is not only validating the signatures, it is making sure the JWE/JWS is syntactically correct,\n  e.g. not having duplicated header parameters between protected/unprotected or per-recipient\n  headers\n\n#### How is it different from [`node-jose`][node-jose]\n\n`node-jose` is built to work in any javascript runtime, to be able to do that it packs a lot of\nbackfill and javascript implementation code in the form of\n[`node-forge`](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge), this significantly increases the footprint\nof the module with dependencies that either aren't ever used or have native implementation available\nin Node.js already, those are often times faster and more reliable.\n\n#### What is the ultimate goal?\n\n- **No dependencies**, the moment JWK formatted keys are supported by node's `crypto` the direct\ndependency count will go down from 1 to 0. 🚀\n- Just the API one needs, having used other jose modules for 3+ years I only include what's useful\n\n#### Why? Just, why?\n\nI was using [`node-jose`][node-jose] for\n[`openid-client`](https://github.com/panva/node-openid-client) and\n[`oidc-provider`](https://github.com/panva/node-oidc-provider) and came to realize its shortcomings\nin terms of performance and API (not having well defined errors).\n\n&plus; this was an amazing opportunity to learn JOSE as a whole\n\n[documentation-jwe]: https://github.com/panva/jose/blob/v2.x/docs/README.md#jwe-json-web-encryption\n[documentation-jwk]: https://github.com/panva/jose/blob/v2.x/docs/README.md#jwk-json-web-key\n[documentation-jwks]: https://github.com/panva/jose/blob/v2.x/docs/README.md#jwks-json-web-key-set\n[documentation-jws]: https://github.com/panva/jose/blob/v2.x/docs/README.md#jws-json-web-signature\n[documentation-jwt]: https://github.com/panva/jose/blob/v2.x/docs/README.md#jwt-json-web-token\n[documentation-none]: https://github.com/panva/jose/blob/v2.x/docs/README.md#jwknone\n[documentation]: https://github.com/panva/jose/blob/v2.x/docs/README.md\n[node-jose]: https://github.com/cisco/node-jose\n[spec-b64]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7797\n[spec-cookbook]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7520\n[spec-jwa]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518\n[spec-jwe]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7516\n[spec-jwk]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517\n[spec-jws]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515\n[spec-jwt]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519\n[spec-okp]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8037\n[spec-secp256k1]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8812\n[draft-ietf-oauth-access-token-jwt]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-access-token-jwt-06\n[draft-jarm]: https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-jarm.html\n[draft-jwtintrospection]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-jwt-introspection-response\n[draft-dpop]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-dpop\n[spec-thumbprint]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7638\n[spec-oidc-id_token]: https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IDToken\n[spec-oidc-logout_token]: https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-backchannel-1_0-04.html#LogoutToken\n[oidc-token-hash]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/oidc-token-hash\n[support-sponsor]: https://github.com/sponsors/panva\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","gitHead":"2269f4b2c56828a0972865f42bf3901cc970cd16","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/panva/jose/issues"},"_id":"jose@2.0.5","_nodeVersion":"14.16.0","_npmVersion":"7.8.0","dist":{"integrity":"sha512-BAiDNeDKTMgk4tvD0BbxJ8xHEHBZgpeRZ1zGPPsitSyMgjoMWiLGYAE7H7NpP5h0lPppQajQs871E8NHUrzVPA==","shasum":"29746a18d9fff7dcf9d5d2a6f62cb0c7cd27abd3","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/jose/-/jose-2.0.5.tgz","fileCount":92,"unpackedSize":240213,"npm-signature":"-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\nVersion: OpenPGP.js v3.0.13\r\nComment: https://openpgpjs.org\r\n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\nA//F\r\n=M/aH\r\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\n","signatures":[{"keyid":"SHA256:jl3bwswu80PjjokCgh0o2w5c2U4LhQAE57gj9cz1kzA","sig":"MEUCIFWGzC7g6ANris4QOczJCX+YYtCru4EN8w0eZsy4zu1TAiEA0rL05TXTgY8JeCj5arjZYLRAMlGPGt+17d8tMCAOgVk="}]},"_npmUser":{"name":"panva","email":"panva.ip@gmail.com"},"directories":{},"maintainers":[{"name":"panva","email":"panva.ip@gmail.com"}],"_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/jose_2.0.5_1617999096079_0.8457999955792006"},"_hasShrinkwrap":false},"1.28.1":{"name":"jose","version":"1.28.1","description":"JSON Web Almost Everything -

The rest is to be considered\nprivate API and is subject to change between any versions.\n\n**Although.** Draft specification profiles are updated as minor versions of the library, therefore,\nsince they may have breaking changes use the `~` semver operator when using these and pay close\nattention to changelog and the drafts themselves.\n\n#### How do I use it outside of Node.js\n\nIt is **only built for >=10.13.0 Node.js** environment - including `jose` in transpiled\nbrowser-environment targeted projects is not supported and may result in unexpected results.\n\n#### How is it different from [`jws`](https://github.com/brianloveswords/node-jws), [`jwa`](https://github.com/brianloveswords/node-jwa) or [`jsonwebtoken`](https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken)?\n\n- it supports JWK Key Format for all four key types (oct, RSA, EC and OKP)\n- it is providing Key and KeyStore abstractions\n- there is JSON Web Encryption support\n- it supports all JWS / JWE Serialization Syntaxes\n- it supports the \"crit\" member validations to make sure extensions are handled correctly\n- it is not only validating the signatures, it is making sure the JWE/JWS is syntactically correct,\n  e.g. not having duplicated header parameters between protected/unprotected or per-recipient\n  headers\n\n#### How is it different from [`node-jose`][node-jose]\n\n`node-jose` is built to work in any javascript runtime, to be able to do that it packs a lot of\nbackfill and javascript implementation code in the form of\n[`node-forge`](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge), this significantly increases the footprint\nof the module with dependencies that either aren't ever used or have native implementation available\nin Node.js already, those are often times faster and more reliable.\n\n#### What is the ultimate goal?\n\n- **No dependencies**, the moment JWK formatted keys are supported by node's `crypto` the direct\ndependency count will go down from 1 to 0. 🚀\n- Just the API one needs, having used other jose modules for 3+ years I only include what's useful\n\n#### Why? Just, why?\n\nI was using [`node-jose`][node-jose] for\n[`openid-client`](https://github.com/panva/node-openid-client) and\n[`oidc-provider`](https://github.com/panva/node-oidc-provider) and came to realize its shortcomings\nin terms of performance and API (not having well defined errors).\n\n&plus; this was an amazing opportunity to learn JOSE as a whole\n\n[documentation-jwe]:

& features\n\nThe following specifications are implemented by `jose`\n\n- JSON Web Signature (JWS) - [RFC7515][spec-jws]\n- JSON Web Encryption (JWE) - [RFC7516][spec-jwe]\n- JSON Web Key (JWK) - [RFC7517][spec-jwk]\n- JSON Web Algorithms (JWA) - [RFC7518][spec-jwa]\n- JSON Web Token (JWT) - [RFC7519][spec-jwt]\n- JSON Web Key Thumbprint - [RFC7638][spec-thumbprint]\n- JWS Unencoded Payload Option - [RFC7797][spec-b64]\n- CFRG Elliptic Curve ECDH and Signatures - [RFC8037][spec-okp]\n- secp256k1 EC Key curve support - [JOSE Registrations for WebAuthn Algorithms][draft-secp256k1]\n\nThe test suite utilizes examples defined in [RFC7520][spec-cookbook] to confirm its JOSE\nimplementation is correct.\n\nAvailable JWT validation profiles\n\n- Generic JWT\n- OIDC ID Token (`id_token`) - [OpenID Connect Core 1.0][spec-oidc-id_token]\n- (draft 04) OIDC Logout Token (`logout_token`) - [OpenID Connect Back-Channel Logout 1.0][spec-oidc-logout_token]\n- (draft 06) OAuth 2.0 JWT Access Tokens (`at+JWT`) - [JWT Profile for OAuth 2.0 Access Tokens][draft-ietf-oauth-access-token-jwt]\n\nDraft profiles are updated as minor versions of the library, therefore, since they may have breaking\nchanges use the `~` semver operator when using these and pay close attention to changelog and the\ndrafts themselves.\n\n## Sponsor\n\n[<img width=\"65\" height=\"65\" align=\"left\" src=\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2824157?s=75&v=4\" alt=\"auth0-logo\">][sponsor-auth0] If you want to quickly add secure token-based authentication to Node.js projects, feel free to check Auth0’s free plan at [auth0.com/overview][sponsor-auth0].<br><br>\n\n## Support\n\nIf you or your business use `jose`, please consider becoming a [sponsor][support-sponsor] so I can continue maintaining it and adding new features carefree.\n\n## Documentation\n\n- [jose API Documentation][documentation]\n  - [JWK (JSON Web Key)][documentation-jwk]\n  - [JWKS (JSON Web Key Set)][documentation-jwks]\n  - [JWT (JSON Web Token)][documentation-jwt]\n  - [JWS (JSON Web Signature)][documentation-jws]\n  - [JWE (JSON Web Encryption)][documentation-jwe]\n\n## Usage\n\nFor the best performance Node.js version **>=12.0.0** is recommended, but **^10.13.0** lts/dubnium\nis also supported.\n\nInstalling `jose`\n\n```console\nnpm install jose\n```\n\nUsage\n```js\nconst jose = require('jose')\nconst {\n  JWE,   // JSON Web Encryption (JWE)\n  JWK,   // JSON Web Key (JWK)\n  JWKS,  // JSON Web Key Set (JWKS)\n  JWS,   // JSON Web Signature (JWS)\n  JWT,   // JSON Web Token (JWT)\n  errors // errors utilized by jose\n} = jose\n```\n\n#### Keys and KeyStores\n\nPrepare your Keys and KeyStores. See the [documentation][documentation-jwk] for more.\n\n```js\nconst key = jose.JWK.asKey(fs.readFileSync('path/to/key/file'))\n\nconst jwk = { kty: 'EC',\n  kid: 'dl4M_fcI7XoFCsQ22PYrQBkuxZ2pDcbDimcdFmmXM98',\n  crv: 'P-256',\n  x: 'v37avifcL-xgh8cy6IFzcINqqmFLc2JF20XUpn4Y2uQ',\n  y: 'QTwy27XgP7ZMOdGOSopAHB-FU1JMQn3J9GEWGtUXreQ' }\nconst anotherKey = jose.JWK.asKey(jwk)\n\nconst keystore = new jose.JWKS.KeyStore(key, anotherKey)\n```\n\n### JWT vs JWS\n\nThe JWT module provides IANA registered claim type and format validations on top of JWS as well as\nconvenience options for verifying UNIX timestamps, setting maximum allowed JWT age, verifying\naudiences, and more.\n\nThe JWS module on the other hand handles the other JWS Serialization Syntaxes with all their\nadditional available features and allows signing of any payload, i.e. not just serialized JSON\nobjects.\n\n#### JWT Signing\n\nSign with a private or symmetric key with plethora of convenience options. See the\n[documentation][documentation-jwt] for more.\n\n```js\njose.JWT.sign(\n  { 'urn:example:claim': 'foo' },\n  privateKey,\n  {\n    algorithm: 'PS256',\n    audience: 'urn:example:client_id',\n    expiresIn: '1 hour',\n    header: {\n      typ: 'JWT'\n    },\n    issuer: 'https://op.example.com'\n  }\n)\n```\n\n#### JWT Verifying\n\nVerify with a public or symmetric key with plethora of convenience options.

The rest is to be considered\nprivate API and is subject to change between any versions.\n\n**Although.** Draft specification profiles are updated as minor versions of the library, therefore,\nsince they may have breaking changes use the `~` semver operator when using these and pay close\nattention to changelog and the drafts themselves.\n\n#### How do I use it outside of Node.js\n\nIt is **only built for >=10.13.0 Node.js** environment - including `jose` in transpiled\nbrowser-environment targeted projects is not supported and may result in unexpected results.\n\n#### How is it different from [`jws`](https://github.com/brianloveswords/node-jws), [`jwa`](https://github.com/brianloveswords/node-jwa) or [`jsonwebtoken`](https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken)?\n\n- it supports JWK Key Format for all four key types (oct, RSA, EC and OKP)\n- it is providing Key and KeyStore abstractions\n- there is JSON Web Encryption support\n- it supports all JWS / JWE Serialization Syntaxes\n- it supports the \"crit\" member validations to make sure extensions are handled correctly\n- it is not only validating the signatures, it is making sure the JWE/JWS is syntactically correct,\n  e.g. not having duplicated header parameters between protected/unprotected or per-recipient\n  headers\n\n#### How is it different from [`node-jose`][node-jose]\n\n`node-jose` is built to work in any javascript runtime, to be able to do that it packs a lot of\nbackfill and javascript implementation code in the form of\n[`node-forge`](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge), this significantly increases the footprint\nof the module with dependencies that either aren't ever used or have native implementation available\nin Node.js already, those are often times faster and more reliable.\n\n#### What is the ultimate goal?\n\n- **No dependencies**, the moment JWK formatted keys are supported by node's `crypto` the direct\ndependency count will go down from 1 to 0. 🚀\n- Just the API one needs, having used other jose modules for 3+ years I only include what's useful\n\n#### Why? Just, why?\n\nI was using [`node-jose`][node-jose] for\n[`openid-client`](https://github.com/panva/node-openid-client) and\n[`oidc-provider`](https://github.com/panva/node-oidc-provider) and came to realize its shortcomings\nin terms of performance and API (not having well defined errors).\n\n&plus; this was an amazing opportunity to learn JOSE as a whole\n\n[documentation-jwe]: /docs/README.md#jwe-json-web-encryption\n[documentation-jwk]: /docs/README.md#jwk-json-web-key\n[documentation-jwks]: /docs/README.md#jwks-json-web-key-set\n[documentation-jws]: /docs/README.md#jws-json-web-signature\n[documentation-jwt]: /docs/README.md#jwt-json-web-token\n[documentation-none]: /docs/README.md#jwknone\n[documentation]: /docs/README.md\n[node-jose]: https://github.com/cisco/node-jose\n[spec-b64]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7797\n[spec-cookbook]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7520\n[spec-jwa]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518\n[spec-jwe]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7516\n[spec-jwk]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517\n[spec-jws]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515\n[spec-jwt]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519\n[spec-okp]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8037\n[draft-secp256k1]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-cose-webauthn-algorithms-04\n[draft-ietf-oauth-access-token-jwt]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-access-token-jwt-06\n[draft-jarm]: https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-jarm.html\n[draft-jwtintrospection]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-jwt-introspection-response\n[spec-thumbprint]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7638\n[spec-oidc-id_token]: https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IDToken\n[spec-oidc-logout_token]: https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-backchannel-1_0-04.html#LogoutToken\n[oidc-token-hash]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/oidc-token-hash\n[support-sponsor]: https://github.com/sponsors/panva\n[sponsor-auth0]: https://auth0.com/overview?utm_source=GHsponsor&utm_medium=GHsponsor&utm_campaign=panva-jose&utm_content=auth\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","gitHead":"179e2a7c22db97386a0495f2d1c31d59d939ed15","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/panva/jose/issues"},"_id":"jose@1.28.2","_nodeVersion":"16.17.0","_npmVersion":"8.17.0","dist":{"integrity":"sha512-wWy51U2MXxYi3g8zk2lsQ8M6O1lartpkxuq1TYexzPKYLgHLZkCjklaATP36I5BUoWjF2sInB9U1Qf18fBZxNA==","shasum":"97f4aa608d0020ae5c1051a2a33247b957401e5a","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/jose/-/jose-1.28.2.tgz","fileCount":91,"unpackedSize":210015,"signatures":[{"keyid":"SHA256:jl3bwswu80PjjokCgh0o2w5c2U4LhQAE57gj9cz1kzA","sig":"MEUCIHkJ1nruxZ4ykszfshGz7XB85tHByn8iFgmXvBDkKeD9AiEAnVWMPIVXT9X43/F8mWsN1292sLOjMjHIS1L/QojbOHE="}],"npm-signature":"-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\nVersion: OpenPGP.js v4.10.10\r\nComment: https://openpgpjs.org\r\n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\r\nyT4iavsCYpnX6LrSBjTfzX5sztwQYxn3tKs=\r\n=19j5\r\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\n"},"_npmUser":{"name":"panva","email":"panva.ip@gmail.com"},"directories":{},"maintainers":[{"name":"panva","email":"panva.ip@gmail.com"}],"_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/jose_1.28.2_1662019291169_0.1725129388082831"},"_hasShrinkwrap":false,"deprecated":"this version is no longer supported"},"2.0.6":{"name":"jose","version":"2.0.6","description":"JSON Web Almost Everything -

The rest is to be considered\nprivate API and is subject to change between any versions.\n\n**Although.** Draft specification profiles are updated as minor versions of the library, therefore,\nsince they may have breaking changes use the `~` semver operator when using these and pay close\nattention to changelog and the drafts themselves.\n\n#### How do I use it outside of Node.js\n\nIt is **only built for >=10.13.0 Node.js** environment - including `jose` in transpiled\nbrowser-environment targeted projects is not supported and may result in unexpected results.\n\n#### How is it different from [`jws`](https://github.com/brianloveswords/node-jws), [`jwa`](https://github.com/brianloveswords/node-jwa) or [`jsonwebtoken`](https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken)?\n\n- it supports JWK Key Format for all four key types (oct, RSA, EC and OKP)\n- it is providing Key and KeyStore abstractions\n- there is JSON Web Encryption support\n- it supports all JWS / JWE Serialization Syntaxes\n- it supports the \"crit\" member validations to make sure extensions are handled correctly\n- it is not only validating the signatures, it is making sure the JWE/JWS is syntactically correct,\n  e.g. not having duplicated header parameters between protected/unprotected or per-recipient\n  headers\n\n#### How is it different from [`node-jose`][node-jose]\n\n`node-jose` is built to work in any javascript runtime, to be able to do that it packs a lot of\nbackfill and javascript implementation code in the form of\n[`node-forge`](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge), this significantly increases the footprint\nof the module with dependencies that either aren't ever used or have native implementation available\nin Node.js already, those are often times faster and more reliable.\n\n#### What is the ultimate goal?\n\n- **No dependencies**, the moment JWK formatted keys are supported by node's `crypto` the direct\ndependency count will go down from 1 to 0. 🚀\n- Just the API one needs, having used other jose modules for 3+ years I only include what's useful\n\n#### Why? Just, why?\n\nI was using [`node-jose`][node-jose] for\n[`openid-client`](https://github.com/panva/node-openid-client) and\n[`oidc-provider`](https://github.com/panva/node-oidc-provider) and came to realize its shortcomings\nin terms of performance and API (not having well defined errors).\n\n&plus; this was an amazing opportunity to learn JOSE as a whole\n\n[documentation-jwe]:

[Node.js Support][]\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Supported Versions\n\n| Version | Security Fixes 🔑 | Other Bug Fixes 🐞 | New Features ⭐ |\n| ------- | --------- | -------- | -------- |\n| [3.x.x](https://github.com/panva/jose) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |\n| [2.x.x](https://github.com/panva/jose/tree/v2.x) | ✅ | ✅ until 2022-04-30 | ❌ |\n| [1.x.x](https://github.com/panva/jose/tree/v1.x) | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |\n\n#### What is new in v3.x?\n\n- Revised API\n- No dependencies\n- Browser, Cloudflare Workers, and Deno support (using [Web Cryptography API][webcrypto])\n- Promise-based API\n\n#### v2.x docs?\n\n[Here.](https://github.com/panva/jose/blob/v2.x/docs/README.md)\n\n#### Semver?\n\n**Yes.** All module's public API is subject to [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).\n\n#### How is it different from [`jws`](https://github.com/brianloveswords/node-jws), [`jwa`](https://github.com/brianloveswords/node-jwa) or [`jsonwebtoken`](https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken)?\n\n- it supports the browser, Cloudflare Workers, and Deno runtimes\n- it supports encrypted JWTs (i.e. in JWE format)\n- supports secp256k1, Ed25519, Ed448, X25519, and X448\n- it supports JWK Key Format for all four key types (oct, RSA, EC and OKP)\n- it is exclusively using native platform Key object representations (CryptoKey and KeyObject)\n- there is JSON Web Encryption support\n- it supports the flattened JWS / JWE Serialization Syntaxes\n- it supports the \"crit\" member validations to make sure extensions are handled correctly\n\n#### How is it different from [`node-jose`](https://github.com/cisco/node-jose)?\n\n`node-jose` is built to work in any javascript runtime, to be able to do that it packs a lot of\npolyfills and javascript implementation code in the form of\n[`node-forge`](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge), this significantly increases the footprint\nof the modules with dependencies that either aren't ever used or have native implementation available\nin the runtime already, those are often times faster and more reliable.\n\n- it has smaller module footprint as it does not bundle unnecessary polyfills\n- it does not bundle [`node-forge`](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge) fallbacks when crypto runtime is unavailable\n- supports secp256k1, Ed25519, Ed448, X25519, and X448\n\n#### Uint8Array?!\n\n- Whenever `Uint8Array` is a valid input, so is [`Buffer`](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer_buffer) since buffers are instances of Uint8Array.\n- Whenever `Uint8Array` is returned and you want a `Buffer` instead, use `Buffer.from(uint8array)`.\n\n#### Bundle Size, Package Size, Tree Shaking\n\nYes the bundle size is on the larger side, that is because each module is actually published \nmultiple times so that it can remain truly without dependencies and be universal / isomorphic.\n\nNevertheless, since each module can be required independently and is fully tree-shakeable, the\ninstall size should not be a cause for concern.\n\n[documentation]: /docs/README.md\n[node-jose]: https://github.com/cisco/node-jose\n[spec-b64]:

is available\n\n`v2.x` continues being supported. It will continue receiving\nbug fixes until 2022-04-30. It will not be receiving any new\nfeatures.\n\n`v3.x` is [available](https://github.com/panva/jose) with\n\n- Revised API\n- No dependencies\n- Browser support\n- Promise-based API\n- experimental (non-blocking 🎉) Node.js libuv thread pool based runtime\n\n## Implemented specs & features\n\nThe following specifications are implemented by `jose`\n\n- JSON Web Signature (JWS) - [RFC7515][spec-jws]\n- JSON Web Encryption (JWE) - [RFC7516][spec-jwe]\n- JSON Web Key (JWK) - [RFC7517][spec-jwk]\n- JSON Web Algorithms (JWA) - [RFC7518][spec-jwa]\n- JSON Web Token (JWT) - [RFC7519][spec-jwt]\n- JSON Web Key Thumbprint - [RFC7638][spec-thumbprint]\n- JWS Unencoded Payload Option - [RFC7797][spec-b64]\n- CFRG Elliptic Curve ECDH and Signatures - [RFC8037][spec-okp]\n- secp256k1 EC Key curve support - [JOSE Registrations for WebAuthn Algorithms][spec-secp256k1]\n\nThe test suite utilizes examples defined in [RFC7520][spec-cookbook] to confirm its JOSE\nimplementation is correct.\n\nAvailable JWT validation profiles\n\n- Generic JWT\n- OIDC ID Token - [OpenID Connect Core 1.0][spec-oidc-id_token]\n- (draft 04) OIDC Logout Token - [OpenID Connect Back-Channel Logout 1.0][spec-oidc-logout_token]\n- (draft 06) OAuth 2.0 JWT Access Tokens - [JWT Profile for OAuth 2.0 Access Tokens][draft-ietf-oauth-access-token-jwt]\n\n## Support\n\nIf you or your business use `jose`, please consider becoming a [sponsor][support-sponsor] so I can continue maintaining it and adding new features carefree.\n\n## Documentation\n\n- [jose API Documentation][documentation]\n  - [JWK (JSON Web Key)][documentation-jwk]\n  - [JWKS (JSON Web Key Set)][documentation-jwks]\n  - [JWT (JSON Web Token)][documentation-jwt]\n  - [JWS (JSON Web Signature)][documentation-jws]\n  - [JWE (JSON Web Encryption)][documentation-jwe]\n\n## Usage\n\nFor the best performance Node.js version **>=12.0.0** is recommended, but **^10.13.0** lts/dubnium\nis also supported.\n\nInstalling `jose`\n\n```console\nnpm install jose@2\n```\n\nUsage\n```js\nconst jose = require('jose')\nconst {\n  JWE,   // JSON Web Encryption (JWE)\n  JWK,   // JSON Web Key (JWK)\n  JWKS,  // JSON Web Key Set (JWKS)\n  JWS,   // JSON Web Signature (JWS)\n  JWT,   // JSON Web Token (JWT)\n  errors // errors utilized by jose\n} = jose\n```\n\n#### Keys and KeyStores\n\nPrepare your Keys and KeyStores. See the [documentation][documentation-jwk] for more.\n\n```js\nconst key = jose.JWK.asKey(fs.readFileSync('path/to/key/file'))\n\nconst jwk = { kty: 'EC',\n  kid: 'dl4M_fcI7XoFCsQ22PYrQBkuxZ2pDcbDimcdFmmXM98',\n  crv: 'P-256',\n  x: 'v37avifcL-xgh8cy6IFzcINqqmFLc2JF20XUpn4Y2uQ',\n  y: 'QTwy27XgP7ZMOdGOSopAHB-FU1JMQn3J9GEWGtUXreQ' }\nconst anotherKey = jose.JWK.asKey(jwk)\n\nconst keystore = new jose.JWKS.KeyStore(key, anotherKey)\n```\n\n### JWT vs JWS\n\nThe JWT module provides IANA registered claim type and format validations on top of JWS as well as\nconvenience options for verifying UNIX timestamps, setting maximum allowed JWT age, verifying\naudiences, and more.\n\nThe JWS module on the other hand handles the other JWS Serialization Syntaxes with all their\nadditional available features and allows signing of any payload, i.e. not just serialized JSON\nobjects.\n\n#### JWT Signing\n\nSign with a private or symmetric key with plethora of convenience options. See the\n[documentation][documentation-jwt] for more.\n\n```js\njose.JWT.sign(\n  { 'urn:example:claim': 'foo' },\n  privateKey,\n  {\n    algorithm: 'PS256',\n    audience: 'urn:example:client_id',\n    expiresIn: '1 hour',\n    header: {\n      typ: 'JWT'\n    },\n    issuer: 'https://op.example.com'\n  }\n)\n```\n\n#### JWT Verifying\n\nVerify with a public or symmetric key with plethora of convenience options.

The rest is to be considered\nprivate API and is subject to change between any versions.\n\n**Although.** Draft specification profiles are updated as minor versions of the library, therefore,\nsince they may have breaking changes use the `~` semver operator when using these and pay close\nattention to changelog and the drafts themselves.\n\n#### How do I use it outside of Node.js\n\nIt is **only built for >=10.13.0 Node.js** environment - including `jose` in transpiled\nbrowser-environment targeted projects is not supported and may result in unexpected results.\n\n#### How is it different from [`jws`](https://github.com/brianloveswords/node-jws), [`jwa`](https://github.com/brianloveswords/node-jwa) or [`jsonwebtoken`](https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken)?\n\n- it supports JWK Key Format for all four key types (oct, RSA, EC and OKP)\n- it is providing Key and KeyStore abstractions\n- there is JSON Web Encryption support\n- it supports all JWS / JWE Serialization Syntaxes\n- it supports the \"crit\" member validations to make sure extensions are handled correctly\n- it is not only validating the signatures, it is making sure the JWE/JWS is syntactically correct,\n  e.g. not having duplicated header parameters between protected/unprotected or per-recipient\n  headers\n\n#### How is it different from [`node-jose`][node-jose]\n\n`node-jose` is built to work in any javascript runtime, to be able to do that it packs a lot of\nbackfill and javascript implementation code in the form of\n[`node-forge`](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge), this significantly increases the footprint\nof the module with dependencies that either aren't ever used or have native implementation available\nin Node.js already, those are often times faster and more reliable.\n\n#### What is the ultimate goal?\n\n- **No dependencies**, the moment JWK formatted keys are supported by node's `crypto` the direct\ndependency count will go down from 1 to 0. 🚀\n- Just the API one needs, having used other jose modules for 3+ years I only include what's useful\n\n#### Why? Just, why?\n\nI was using [`node-jose`][node-jose] for\n[`openid-client`](https://github.com/panva/node-openid-client) and\n[`oidc-provider`](https://github.com/panva/node-oidc-provider) and came to realize its shortcomings\nin terms of performance and API (not having well defined errors).\n\n&plus; this was an amazing opportunity to learn JOSE as a whole\n\n[documentation-jwe]: https://github.com/panva/jose/blob/v2.x/docs/README.md#jwe-json-web-encryption\n[documentation-jwk]: https://github.com/panva/jose/blob/v2.x/docs/README.md#jwk-json-web-key\n[documentation-jwks]: https://github.com/panva/jose/blob/v2.x/docs/README.md#jwks-json-web-key-set\n[documentation-jws]: https://github.com/panva/jose/blob/v2.x/docs/README.md#jws-json-web-signature\n[documentation-jwt]: https://github.com/panva/jose/blob/v2.x/docs/README.md#jwt-json-web-token\n[documentation-none]: https://github.com/panva/jose/blob/v2.x/docs/README.md#jwknone\n[documentation]: https://github.com/panva/jose/blob/v2.x/docs/README.md\n[node-jose]: https://github.com/cisco/node-jose\n[spec-b64]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7797\n[spec-cookbook]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7520\n[spec-jwa]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518\n[spec-jwe]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7516\n[spec-jwk]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517\n[spec-jws]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515\n[spec-jwt]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519\n[spec-okp]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8037\n[spec-secp256k1]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8812\n[draft-ietf-oauth-access-token-jwt]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-access-token-jwt-06\n[draft-jarm]: https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-jarm.html\n[draft-jwtintrospection]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-jwt-introspection-response\n[draft-dpop]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-dpop\n[spec-thumbprint]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7638\n[spec-oidc-id_token]: https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IDToken\n[spec-oidc-logout_token]: https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-backchannel-1_0-04.html#LogoutToken\n[oidc-token-hash]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/oidc-token-hash\n[support-sponsor]: https://github.com/sponsors/panva\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","gitHead":"0fbe2e68c77d3201bafda2592a21cccd7e7b3136","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/panva/jose/issues"},"_nodeVersion":"20.11.1","_npmVersion":"10.4.0","dist":{"integrity":"sha512-5hFWIigKqC+e/lRyQhfnirrAqUdIPMB7SJRqflJaO29dW7q5DFvH1XCSTmv6PQ6pb++0k6MJlLRoS0Wv4s38Wg==","shasum":"3aabbaec70bff313c108b9406498a163737b16ba","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/jose/-/jose-2.0.7.tgz","fileCount":91,"unpackedSize":213385,"signatures":[{"keyid":"SHA256:jl3bwswu80PjjokCgh0o2w5c2U4LhQAE57gj9cz1kzA","sig":"MEUCIQDMxDsVNl85rt2aR5vs/u7c2WQMDc+0Lh4DNl5MwOYhqgIgF057xp9azwZ6RbZB6zAMYnF3iF7hrqDjk3u3fwKZmDQ="}]},"_npmUser":{"name":"panva","email":"panva.ip@gmail.com"},"directories":{},"maintainers":[{"name":"panva","email":"panva.ip@gmail.com"}],"_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/jose_2.0.7_1709812455287_0.9159927504423457"},"_hasShrinkwrap":false},"4.15.5":{"name":"jose","version":"4.15.5","description":"'JSON Web Almost Everything' - JWA, JWS, JWE, JWT, JWK, JWKS for Node.js, Browser, Cloudflare Workers, Deno, Bun, and other Web-interoperable runtimes","keywords":["browser","bun","cloudflare","compact","decode","decrypt","deno","detached","ec","ecdsa","eddsa","edge","electron","embedded","encrypt","flattened","general","jose","json web token","jsonwebtoken","jwa","jwe","jwk","jwks","jws","jwt","netlify","next","nextjs","oct","okp","payload","pem","pkcs8","rsa","secp256k1","sign","signature","spki","validate","vercel","verify","webcrypto","workerd","workers","x509"],"homepage":"https://github.com/panva/jose","repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/panva/jose.git"},"funding":{"url":"https://github.com/sponsors/panva"},"license":"MIT","author":{"name":"Filip Skokan","email":"panva.ip@gmail.com"},"sideEffects":false,"exports":{".":{"types":"./dist/types/index.d.ts","bun":"./dist/browser/index.js","deno":"./dist/browser/index.js","browser":"./dist/browser/index.js","worker":"./dist/browser/index.js","import":"./dist/node/esm/index.js","require":"./dist/node/cjs/index.js"},"./package.json":"./package.json"},"main":"./dist/node/cjs/index.js","browser":"./dist/browser/index.js","types":"./dist/types/index.d.ts","deno":"./dist/browser/index.js","_id":"jose@4.15.5","readme":"# jose\n\n`jose` is JavaScript module for JSON Object Signing and Encryption, providing support for JSON Web Tokens (JWT), JSON Web Signature (JWS), JSON Web Encryption (JWE), JSON Web Key (JWK), JSON Web Key Set (JWKS), and more.
